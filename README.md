# freshwater

This is a Shiny app that shows the surface area and volume of the world's bodies of fresh water. It also allows for grouping by region, e.g., The Great Lakes. The purpose is to compare the sizes of bodies of water around the world. It's kind of interesting, albeit not particularly useful. For instance, Lake Baikal has a greater volume of water than the five North American Great Lakes combined! Cool, but so what?
